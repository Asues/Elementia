### Program Description
This game use Vofuria and PhotonNetworks frameworks.</br>
Because i can't send the defined class (like ElementiaPlayer, ElementiaMonster class) through Phton framework to the other player, so we must send ```string``` values from player one to the server, then player two will call the values from the photon cloud service, then the attribute, like HP and attack  will changed.
